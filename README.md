User music reccomendation algorithm that takes into account previous user's ratings and reccomends similar taste users/songs they liked you haven't listened to yet. In progress but prototype does work.

TO DO: add functionality for new user entry, use previous data to predict good song user hasn't listened to to see if they'll like it.

IDEAS: want to create a song reccomendation algorithm that goes off some interesting piece of data
  |-> thinking political quiz scores, easiest political compass: enter the values you got from the quiz then see what the algorithm would reccomend
