User music reccomendation algorithm that takes into account previous user's ratings and reccomends similar taste users/songs they liked you haven't listened to yet. 

Algorithm is working very well, but I want to add more features/expand on classes. Want an implementation beyond finding closest user to you and saying their favorite song.

#### IDEAS: 
 - Option to add a new song to the data (and adjust scores accordingly, could just make old users a 3)
 - Option to adjust an existing user's scores, maybe ask "do you want to adjust scores or just calculate distance?"
 - New class that takes into account political leanings or something else?want to create a song reccomendation algorithm that goes off some interesting piece of data
  |-> thinking political quiz scores, easiest political compass: enter the values you got from the quiz then see what the algorithm would reccomend
